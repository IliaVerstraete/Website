<h3>I made this website as part of my Geographical Information Systems (GIS) course. This taught me a lot about coding, specifically using 'Sublime Text' to make a website, neither of which I had done before. Therefore, this process was very beneficial and informative to me. In addition, all the maps that are found in the 'Maps' folder are mine. Using data from online (the UN's Open SDG Data Hub), I learned how to visualise and analyse spatial data using tools such as ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, QGIS and Google Earth Engine. All of these tools proved very useful, and I am grateful to have acquired the knowledge to navigate them to a basic level, as I am sure it will benefit me in the future.
